This file maintains a directory listing of the NoRedist folder which contains
utilities and tools that are generally free for anyone to download and use,
but are not redistributable by Epic. Also included are instructions for
acquiring these tools yourself.

NoRedist\ImgTec\PVRUniSCo.exe

	This tool can be acquired from Imagination Technologies 
	http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/insider/powervr-pvrunisco.asp

	From the installation, copy the PVRUniSCo.exe binary into the NoRedist\ImgTec directory.
	
	Note that this is only used for profiling GLES2 shaders and is disabled by default via a .ini file setting.
	
NoRedist\PIB\PVKImport.exe

	This tool can be acquired from Microsoft
	http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=F9992C94-B129-46BC-B240-414BDFF679A7&displaylang=en

	This is for creating a PKCS#12 certificate (.pfx) from a Software Publisher Certificate (.spc) and a Private Key (.pvk) for importing into a Mozilla certificate database.
	
	
NoRedist\Compressonator\TheCompressonator.exe

	This tool can be acquired from AMD:
	http://developer.amd.com/gpu/compressonator/pages/default.aspx
	
	After full installing TheCompressonator (to Program Files, by default), copy all the files into the NoRedist\Compressenator
	directory, so you will have a few .exes, a few .dlls, and a Plugins directory.
	
	Note that this is only used for compressing textures for ATI-powered Android devices.
