Gears of War Model Pack

Characters, Weapons and Environmental Objects (props).

Important: 

As for PS3, everything works perfectly (GOW Weapons and Characters), except GOW props (static meshes). That`s because GOW Static Meshes were extracted directly from upk and recooked in UDK Ultimate, but for PS3, the PS3Tools.dll can`t cook a recooked static mesh, that means if you want to use some Gears of War Props on PS3, you need the extract these props using Unreal Model Viewer (included on the download), then import this prop on 3dsmax, then export it to UDK Ultimate as FBX, and recreate the package. 

As for PC and Xbox360, they are ready for use.
